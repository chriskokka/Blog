Blog


This is a simple blog engine written in Java using Play Framework 2.1.
User registration is available and needed to create posts.
The recent posts will be displayed on the front page of the blog and there
are separate pages for editing/deleting posts and also for adding new ones.

Passwords are stored without any hashing in the database. Since this project
uses the h2 in memory database it does not matter that much. For production
of course it is necessary to create hashing and salting.
